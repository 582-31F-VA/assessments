# Solution

You will find two kinds of source file in this solution: JavaScript
files ending in `.js` and TypeScript files ending `.ts`. TypeScript is
a superset of JavaScript which adds strong typing. It is widely used
today both on the front- and back-end, maybe more so than JavaScript.
You can focus solely on the JavaScript files, but you can also take a
look at the TypeScript versions which has more documentation.
